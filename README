release of the dvda-author-gui version 10.05,  31 May 2010 (Qt 4.6.2 build)

To build from source, please install Qt4.4 on your machine or later.
(http://qt.nokia.com)

INSTALL instructions

under windows, run the installer. 

The latests dynamic library mingwm10.dll is provided for convenience.
In rare cases, this version might be incompatible with an already installed one. In this case, 
- if your version is newer, erase the distributed version and check that your mingwm10.dll is in your PATH;
- if your version is older, it is advised to replace it with the distributed one.

Under MSYS or CYGWIN, you may run the Makefile without installing mingwm10.dll provided that you have a MinGW
distribution with mingwm10.dll in your PATH.

under linux, enter make to build the executable, then (sudo/root) copy gui to a /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin directory.


DEPENDENCIES

You should have a recent dvda-author executable installed in your PATH, 
as well as a patched version of mkisofs (see How to section on the webpage for instructions to build the patch),
if you want to use the ISO file creation feature.
You should have cdrecord installed to be able to burn discs.

Linux note
----------
On Debian linux at least, if you want to compile cdrecord from fresh Jorg Schilling source code, use a recent package 
(version a57 was tested to build) and build with Gmake.linux (root-) copied to/usr/bin.
Another option is to use wodim (Debian fork of cdrecord) and edit a symlink to wodim as cdrecord.

Options usage
-------------

If you want to burn a disc with cdrecord, first check the "Burn disc with cdrecord" then enter a path in the line edit.
It will be kept in memory until changed.
On many linux distribution, you will be able to enter a "standard" path like /dev/scd0. 
If this does not work you can also enter a SCSI bus code, like: 2,0,0
To know which kind of path/bus code you should enter, open a command line window and type cdrecord -devices and cdrecord -scanbus
if this fails.
On Ubuntu, cdrecord -devices yields the following output:

cdrecord -devices
wodim: Overview of accessible drives (1 found) :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 0  dev='/dev/scd0'     rwrw-- : 'TSSTcorp' 'CD/DVDW SH-S182M'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build under windows, define LOCAL with -DLOCAL at compile time, which may be specified in the .pro file with DEFINES += LOCAL
